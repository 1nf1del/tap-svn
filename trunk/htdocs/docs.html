  <h1>TAP Project - Documentation</h1>

  <p>The project documentation is broken down into smaller modules
  designed to cover particular topics. Some modules provide step by
  step instructions, others cover things in more generic terms.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Mailing lists</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Optional, but highly recommended: If you have not already
      done so, subscribe to the project mailing lists:</p>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <a href=
        "https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/tap-announce">TAP-announce</a>
        for project related announcements. This is a moderated, low
        traffic list.<br>
        <a href=
        "https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/tap-devel">TAP-devel</a>
        for developer talk. Subscribers can post to this list to
        collaborate.<br>

    <dt>Text editor</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>You will need a decent text editor suitable for
      programming. Your editor needs to support UNIX line endings.
      Windows Notepad will not do.</p>

      <p>There are several very powerful text editors, such as vim
      and emacs, available on most UNIX systems and in Cygwin.
      Windows and Mac users may find these editors a bit hard to
      use initially, however there are plenty of alternative
      editors available. Windows users may wish to take a look at
      <a href="http://www.pnotepad.org/">Programmers Notepad 2</a>,
      Mac users can check out <a href=
      "http://smultron.sourceforge.net/">Smultron</a>.</p>

    <dt>Cygwin</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Only relevant to those using Windows computers. Explains
      how to install and configure Cygwin - the UNIX compatibility
      environment.</p>

    </dd>

    <dt>Compiler (toolchain) installation</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>In order to compiler TAPs, you need to install the
      compiler, linker, header files and other utilitites. This is
      also known as the toolchain.</p>

      <p>The toolchain can be downloaded from the <a href=
      "http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4128">
      download section</a> of the project. There are binaries
      available for several platforms. These are intended to be
      installed in <span class=
      "code">/usr/local/topfield-gcc</span></p>

    <dt>TAP project environmet setup</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This is relevant to everyone. Explains how to create the
      required directories and retrieve all the current source
      code. Also explains how to create your own project and use
      the Makefile based build infrastructure to have your TAPs
      compiled automatically.</p><a href=
