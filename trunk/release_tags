Please add your descriptions of release tags when you create them.

Make sure that you provide some high level release notes for each tag.

The format is simple the tag line must start the string "TAG:", then
the rest of that line is the path to the tag (relative to the tag
level of the repository), then all subsequent lines until the next
tag keyword (or end of file) form the release notes for that tag.

TAG:libs/mylib-1.0
First public release of mylib.

TAG:libs/mylib-1.1
* Fixes a bug where the call to is_cpu_on_fire() would always
  return false, even though one or more of the CPUs could infact
  be in flames.

* Breaks source level compatibility with put_out_fire() by
  requiring fire suppresant type as an argument.
