Please add your descriptions of release tags when you create them.

Make sure that you provide some high level release notes for each tag.

The format is simple the tag line must start the string "TAG:", then
the rest of that line is the path to the tag (relative to the tag
level of the repository), then all subsequent lines until the next
tag keyword (or end of file) form the release notes for that tag.

TAG:libs/mylib-1.0
First public release of mylib.

TAG:libs/mylib-1.1
* Fixes a bug where the call to is_cpu_on_fire() would always
  return false, even though one or more of the CPUs could infact
  be in flames.

* Breaks source level compatibility with put_out_fire() by
  requiring fire suppresant type as an argument.

TAG:libs/libutils-1.2
First release of libutils through berlios. libutils is a library of functions 
for TAP programmers. It contains
* a basic implementation of the System V file functions, fopen/fclose/fgets/fputs
  (borrowed extensively from K&R)
* a basic implementation of Win32 INI GetPrivateProfileString/WritePrivateProfileString
* a key mapper utility that externalises a TAPs Remote Control key assignment. 
  This would allow a end user to modify the key assignments for the TAP to 
  his/her liking.
* various utility functions such as vsprintf, atoi, and strtok implementations
  otherwise not available on the Topfield

TAG:taps/gcode-1.6
First release of gcode through berlios.
* The gcode tap allows you to create timer entries by using GCodes found in 
  printed TV guides. The GCode algorithm is the same as Europe's Showview so 
  this tap should work Showview as well.
* Limitation: This TAP only supports GCodes of 1-6 characters in length (by far
  the most common). The algorithm for decoding longer codes has not been made 
  public yet...

TAG:taps/macro-1.0
First release of macro through berlios.
* macro is a TAP that executes one or more keys for each macro key defined. 
  Invocation of a macro can be through a single RC key, or a combination of a 
  “function” key together with a RC key (e.g. similar to Alt TAB on a PC). 
* the use of the function key can be varied to be always on, i.e. No function 
  key is required, or use key once, i.e. press the function key once to enable 
  the macros and from then on simply press the RC key to invoke the macro, or 
  use key every time, i.e. you must press the function key with the RC key to 
  invoke the macro 

TAG:tools/toolchain-1.0a
First public release of Topfield TAP toolchain creator. Contributed by Steve
Bennett.

TAG:tools/toolchain-1.1
* Various updates for OS X, FreedBSD and cygwin
