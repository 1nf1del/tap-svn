Running TAPs screen
This screen shows free memory at the top right corner and a list of all running TAPs. The free memory may not respond immediately to TAPs being exited, but over time should reflect how much memory you have available.

To configure a TAP press OK
To stop a TAP press Stop or White.
To stop all compatible TAPs press PIP Swap (next to white). 
To temporarily disable or enable a TAP press Red. Green will toggle all TAPs. Note that TAPs that hack the firmware directly like the Display TAP may behave strangely when disabled.

Auto Start TAPs screen
To reorder TAPs use Left and Right.
To disable or enable a TAP press Red. Green will toggle all TAPs.
The currently displayed order and enabled state can be saved and reapplied. This can be useful when diagnosing TAP problems or if you like to disable TAPs whilst on holiday.
Apply any changes you have made by selecting Save, or pressing Record. TAPs will be loaded in this order next time the toppy starts. If any errors occur during the reordering process, you will be warned with an on screen message. Some TAPs may get left in the Temp Auto Start directory which you will have to manually move back to Auto Start.

If the Auto Start TAPs screen screen isn't available you can reorder from your PC using Altair by deleting all TAPs from AutoStart and then adding them in the order you would like them to load.

Options Screen
TAP Commander options can be accessed by pressing Menu from any TAP Commander screen. Skin, screen offset and additional activation key can be adjusted.
