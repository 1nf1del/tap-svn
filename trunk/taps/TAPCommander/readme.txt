TAPCommander 0.1 Beta

TAPCommander allows you to reorder and temporarily disable TAPs whilst your Toppy is running.

Press Recall whilst the Toppy's main menu is displayed or Exit to display the TAPCommander menu. This menu shows the 15 available TAP slots and any running TAPs. Disabled TAPs are indicated with a *.

Left and Right move a TAP up and down the list.
Red and OK shows the configuration menu for any TAPCommander compliant TAPs (none as yet!)
Yellow enables and disables a TAP.
White stops any TAPCommander compliant TAPs.

Note that TAPCommander doesn't change the order that TAPs load from AutoStart, but it will enable you to work out the best order more easily. You can reorder using Altair by deleting all TAPs from AutoStart and then adding them in the order you would like them to load.
