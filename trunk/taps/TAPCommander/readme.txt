TAP Commander 1.0 Beta 3

TAP Commander allows you to configure and and temporarily disable TAPs whilst your Toppy is running. It can also change the load order of TAPs in your Auto Start directory.

To activate TAP Commander screen, press Menu whilst the Toppy's main menu (i.e. press Menu twice)

Running TAPs screen
This screen shows free memory at the top right corner and a list of all running TAPs. The free memory may not respond immediately to TAPs being exited, but over time should reflect how much memory you have available.

To configure a TAP press OK
To stop a TAP press Stop or White
To temporarily disable or enable a TAP press Red. Note that TAPs that hack the firmware directly like the Display TAP may behave strangely when disabled.
To access the Auto Start reordering screen, press the Archive button.

Auto Start TAPs screen
To reorder TAPs use Left and Right.
Selecting the Save menu item will save your changes to disk. TAPs will be loaded in this order next time the toppy starts.
If any errors occur during the reordering process, you will be warned with an on screen message. Some TAPs may get left in the Temp Auto Start directory which you will have to manually move back to Auto Start.

If the Auto Start TAPs screen screen isn't available you can reorder from your PC using Altair by deleting all TAPs from AutoStart and then adding them in the order you would like them to load.

TAP Commander can be configured to look like MyStuff by editing the values found in default.ini
