<font face=Arial ><a name=""><h1>Topfield TAP toolchain creator 1.1</h1></a></font>
<font face=Arial ><a name=""><h2>Introduction</h2></a></font>
While Topfield kindly provide a TAP development toolchain for cygwin under Windows, this is not the ideal environment for many developers.
<p>
To remedy this situation, I have created this package which creates a toolchain for Linux, or probably almost any Unix variant including OS X.
<p>
(If you do successfully build a toolchain on a non-Linux platform, please let me know)
<font face=Arial ><a name=""><h2>Download</h2></a></font>
From <a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~msteveb/topfield/toolchain/topfield-toolchain-1.1.tar.gz">http://members.ozemail.com.au/~msteveb/topfield/toolchain/topfield-toolchain-1.1.tar.gz</a> or from the Berlios website (see below)
<p>
This project is now hosted at Berlios <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/tap">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/tap</a>/ with both this package and a number of binary toolchains now available at <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4128">http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4128</a> including Linux/x86, Mac OS X/powerpc and Windows-cygwin/x86
<font face=Arial ><a name=""><h2>Quick Start</h2></a></font>
<font face=Arial ><a name=""><h3>Build Your Own</h3></a></font>
To build your own toolchain, simply create the directory /usr/local/topfield-gcc which is writable by you and then run <b>make</b>
<p>
All required packages will be downloaded, unpacked, patched, configured, built and installed.
<p>
Additionally some test TAP applications will be built using the new toolchain in <b>taptest</b>
<font face=Arial ><a name=""><h3>Use a Binary Toolchain</h3></a></font>
If you are downloading one of the prebuilt binary toolchains, unpack it from the root directory. It will go into /usr/local/topfield-gcc directory.
<p>
Download and unpack taptest.tar.gz wherever you like, and run <b>make</b> in the taptest directory.
<p>
Examine taps.mak and the Makefile for the appropriate compiler arguments to built taps.
<font face=Arial ><a name=""><h2>Advanced Instructions</h2></a></font>
If you already have some or all of the required packages, or you don't want them auto-downloaded, copy them into the <b>pkg</b> directory.
<p>
It should be possible to install the tools into a different location by changing PREFIX at the top of the Makefile.
<p>
The latest 1.22 Topfield SDK is installed in /usr/local/topfield-gcc/topfield-sdk as a convenience. This is not required by the toolchain but is used to verify that the test taps will build.
<font face=Arial ><a name=""><h2>How I did it</h2></a></font>
I started with Eric Fry's excellent instructions at <a href="http://www.isp.net.au/~eric/topfield">http://www.isp.net.au/~eric/topfield</a>/
<p>
Unfortunately, the instructions were not quite complete and the resulting toolchain only worked for the simplest applications. It also required use of the Topfield-supplied libc and libm which was not ideal.
<p>
After some investigation I came across the QNX public CVS access at <a href="http://cvs.qnx.com">http://cvs.qnx.com</a>/ This CVS tree is very much out of date, but the binutils and gcc compiler produced almost exactly the same results as the Topfield cygwin-based tools. Carefully examining the differences between the outputs produced by the Topfield tools and the QNX tools showed that:
<ol type=1>
  <li>-fno-delayed-branch is required for the assembler to product working code
  <li>In some cases the assembler incorrectly uses s7 as the offset register rather than gp
  <li>The linker, ld, was non-functional
</ol>
<p>
As luck would have it, the linker created by Eric Fry's binutils version <b>did</b> work. I picked up the latest version of the binutils patch from this post by Jeff Baker at QNX <a href="http://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2004-09/msg00149.html">http://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2004-09/msg00149.html</a> (Unfortunately this patch has never made it into the latest binutils release and did not patch cleanly over binutils-2.16.1. Thus I checked out of the binutils cvs to the date 20040817 and created a patch between binutils-2.15 and this version.)
<p>
This new linker produced a rel.dyn section which was not produced by the Topfield linker, so I modified tap.ld to discard this section.
<p>
Further examination allowed me to deduce under which situations the gp rather than the s7 register should be used by the assembler and I created a small patch to address this.
<p>
At this point, I had a working set of binutils including assembler and linker and also a working gcc. Now the goal was to ensure that the libc.a, libm.a and libgcc.a where functional. This means that they needed to be built with the options: -mlong-calls -mqnxpic -fno-delayed-branch -msoft-float
<p>
I had to create another small patch to gcc to allow it to accept TARGET_CFLAGS from the environment (newlib already did this). This produced a working set of libraries.
<p>
Finally, I wanted to make it easy for others to build their own toolchains for other platforms, so I created a Makefile will would completely codify the instructions for building the toolchain, including fetching and installing the Topfield TAP SDK and building some sample TAP applications.
