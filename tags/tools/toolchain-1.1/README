Topfield TAP toolchain creator 1.1
==================================

Introduction
------------
While Topfield kindly provide a TAP development toolchain for cygwin under Windows,
this is not the ideal environment for many developers.

To remedy this situation, I have created this package which creates
a toolchain for Linux, or probably almost any Unix variant including OS X.

(If you do successfully build a toolchain on a non-Linux platform, please let
me know)

Download
--------

From http://members.ozemail.com.au/~msteveb/topfield/toolchain/topfield-toolchain-1.1.tar.gz
or from the Berlios website (see below)

This project is now hosted at Berlios
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/tap/ with both this
package and a number of binary toolchains now available at
http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4128 including
Linux/x86, Mac OS X/powerpc and Windows-cygwin/x86

Quick Start
-----------

  Build Your Own
  --------------

  To build your own toolchain, simply create the directory
  /usr/local/topfield-gcc which is writable by you and then run *make*

  All required packages will be downloaded, unpacked, patched, configured,
  built and installed.

  Additionally some test TAP applications will be built using the new
  toolchain in *taptest*

  Use a Binary Toolchain
  ----------------------

  If you are downloading one of the prebuilt binary toolchains, unpack it
  from the root directory. It will go into /usr/local/topfield-gcc directory.

  Download and unpack taptest.tar.gz wherever you like, and run *make* in
  the taptest directory.

  Examine taps.mak and the Makefile for the appropriate compiler arguments
  to built taps.

Advanced Instructions
---------------------

If you already have some or all of the required packages, or you don't want
them auto-downloaded, copy them into the *pkg* directory.

It should be possible to install the tools into a different location by
changing PREFIX at the top of the Makefile.

The latest 1.22 Topfield SDK is installed in /usr/local/topfield-gcc/topfield-sdk
as a convenience. This is not required by the toolchain but is used to verify
that the test taps will build.

How I did it
------------

I started with Eric Fry's excellent instructions at http://www.isp.net.au/~eric/topfield/

Unfortunately, the instructions were not quite complete and the resulting toolchain
only worked for the simplest applications. It also required use of the Topfield-supplied
libc and libm which was not ideal.

After some investigation I came across the QNX public CVS access at http://cvs.qnx.com/
This CVS tree is very much out of date, but the binutils and gcc compiler produced
almost exactly the same results as the Topfield cygwin-based tools. Carefully examining
the differences between the outputs produced by the Topfield tools and the QNX tools
showed that:
1. -fno-delayed-branch is required for the assembler to product working code
2. In some cases the assembler incorrectly uses s7 as the offset register rather than gp
3. The linker, ld, was non-functional

As luck would have it, the linker created by Eric Fry's binutils version *did* work.
I picked up the latest version of the binutils patch from this post by Jeff Baker at QNX
http://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2004-09/msg00149.html
(Unfortunately this patch has never made it into the latest binutils release and did
not patch cleanly over binutils-2.16.1. Thus I checked out of the binutils cvs to the
date 20040817 and created a patch between binutils-2.15 and this version.)

This new linker produced a rel.dyn section which was not produced by the Topfield linker,
so I modified tap.ld to discard this section.

Further examination allowed me to deduce under which situations the gp rather than
the s7 register should be used by the assembler and I created a small patch to address this.

At this point, I had a working set of binutils including assembler and linker and also
a working gcc. Now the goal was to ensure that the libc.a, libm.a and libgcc.a where
functional. This means that they needed to be built with the options:
-mlong-calls -mqnxpic -fno-delayed-branch -msoft-float

I had to create another small patch to gcc to allow it to accept
TARGET_CFLAGS from the environment (newlib already did this).
This produced a working set of libraries.

Finally, I wanted to make it easy for others to build their own toolchains
for other platforms, so I created a Makefile will would completely codify the
instructions for building the toolchain, including fetching and installing the
Topfield TAP SDK and building some sample TAP applications.

Notes for Specific Hosts
------------------------

  FreeBSD 4.11
  ------------
  - Need to use gnu make (gmake)
  - Need to install and use gnu sed
  - Need to install and use gnu patch

  OS X 10.4
  ---------
  - I added a couple of minor patches from cazlar to build under OS X

  Windows/cygwin
  --------------
  - I now use 'sh configure ...' in the Makefile
